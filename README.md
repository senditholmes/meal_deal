# Meal Deal
Program to scrape, store, and display the various different combinations possible for the world famous TESCO meal deal. 
One sandwich, one snack, one drink...which combo will you get?
This idea originally sprang up after seeing a meme in which people purposely choose the worst value/tasting/looking meal deals.

## Beautiful Soup
Scraped the data of a supermarket website to store the various objects available for a meal deal.

## React
Displayed these objects using basic css and rendering with react.

## Next Steps
Re-impliment this with various different tools for "best value", "worst value" etc.
